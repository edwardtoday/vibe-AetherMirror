# Particle Mirror - Product Requirements (PRD)

## 1. Positioning
Browser-based art toy that turns your mirrored webcam feed into reactive particles. Focus on immediacy and visual delight, not utility.

## 2. Target users
- Creatives, developers, students who enjoy visual experiments.
- Workshop/event hosts needing an interactive visual opener.

## 3. Core experience
1) Open page → allow camera (mirrored).  
2) Screen becomes a particle mirror.  
3) Your motion disturbs particles with visible reactions.  
4) Hotkeys switch rendering/physics modes for different feels.

## 4. Current scope
- Four modes: Simple gas (Canvas), Physics gas (Matter.js), Three.js points, Flow field.
- Hotkeys 1/2/3/4 to switch; minimal overlay help.
- Motion-driven pulses; faint 3% pixelated video overlay for reference.

## 5. Interaction / IA
- Fullscreen visual + small overlay; no deep menus; rely on hotkeys.

## 6. Success (subjective)
- Understandable in 30s; users try multiple motions; some share captures.

## 7. Future ideas
- More visual styles, recording, performance presets, sound toggle.
